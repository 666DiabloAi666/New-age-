✅ Test the Base Symbolic AI Layer

1. Install Requirements

Update your requirements.txt:

pytest

Then run locally:

pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/


---

2. GitHub Actions Confirmation

Your CI pipeline will now pick up pytest and run it via tests/test_symbolic_ai.py. Confirm that the next GitHub Actions run completes without error.


---

3. Next Steps (After Testing Passes)

Once you're satisfied with the symbolic AI base, we'll:

✅ Add sigil combinatorics and mana fade logic

✅ Integrate with KarmaChain, OWE CODE, or Verdict of the Burning Crown

✅ Generate a proper CMakeLists.txt for Rust/Python builds

✅ Add a Makefile for CLI orchestration (make test, make build, make deploy)
