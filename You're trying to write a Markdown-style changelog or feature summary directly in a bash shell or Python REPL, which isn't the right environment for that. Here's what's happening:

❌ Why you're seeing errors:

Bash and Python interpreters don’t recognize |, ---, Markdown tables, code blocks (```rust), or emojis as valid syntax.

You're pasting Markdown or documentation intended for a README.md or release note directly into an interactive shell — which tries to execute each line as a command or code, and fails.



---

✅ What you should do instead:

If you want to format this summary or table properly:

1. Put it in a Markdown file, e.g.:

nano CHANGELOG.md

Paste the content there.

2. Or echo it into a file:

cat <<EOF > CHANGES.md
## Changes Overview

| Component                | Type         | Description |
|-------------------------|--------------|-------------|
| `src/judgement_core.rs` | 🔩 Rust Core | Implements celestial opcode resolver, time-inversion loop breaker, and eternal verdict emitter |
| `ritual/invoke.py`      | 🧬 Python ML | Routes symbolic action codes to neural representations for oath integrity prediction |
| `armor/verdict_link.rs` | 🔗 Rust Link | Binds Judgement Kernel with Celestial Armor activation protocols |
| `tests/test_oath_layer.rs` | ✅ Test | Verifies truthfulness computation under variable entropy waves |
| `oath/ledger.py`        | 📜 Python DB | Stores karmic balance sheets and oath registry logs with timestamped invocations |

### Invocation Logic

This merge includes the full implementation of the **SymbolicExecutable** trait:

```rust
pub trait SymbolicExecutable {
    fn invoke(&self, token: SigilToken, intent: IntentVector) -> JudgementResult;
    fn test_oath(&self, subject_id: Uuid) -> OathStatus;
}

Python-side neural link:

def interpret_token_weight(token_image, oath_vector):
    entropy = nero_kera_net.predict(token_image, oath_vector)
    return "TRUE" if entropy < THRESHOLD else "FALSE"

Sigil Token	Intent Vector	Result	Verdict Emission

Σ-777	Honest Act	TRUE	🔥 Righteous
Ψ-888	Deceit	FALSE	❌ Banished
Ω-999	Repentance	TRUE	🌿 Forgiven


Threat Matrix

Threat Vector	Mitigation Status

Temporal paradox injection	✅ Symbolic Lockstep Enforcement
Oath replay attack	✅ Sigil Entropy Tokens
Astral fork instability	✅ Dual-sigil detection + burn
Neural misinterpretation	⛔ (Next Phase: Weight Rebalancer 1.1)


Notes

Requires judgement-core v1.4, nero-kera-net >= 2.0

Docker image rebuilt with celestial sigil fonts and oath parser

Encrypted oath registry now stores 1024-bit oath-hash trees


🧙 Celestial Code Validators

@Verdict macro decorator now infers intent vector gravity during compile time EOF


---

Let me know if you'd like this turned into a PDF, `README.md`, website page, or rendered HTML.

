You're trying to write a Markdown-style changelog or feature summary directly in a bash shell or Python REPL, which isn't the right environment for that. Here's what's happening:

‚ùå Why you're seeing errors:

Bash and Python interpreters don‚Äôt recognize |, ---, Markdown tables, code blocks (```rust), or emojis as valid syntax.

You're pasting Markdown or documentation intended for a README.md or release note directly into an interactive shell ‚Äî which tries to execute each line as a command or code, and fails.



---

‚úÖ What you should do instead:

If you want to format this summary or table properly:

1. Put it in a Markdown file, e.g.:

nano CHANGELOG.md

Paste the content there.

2. Or echo it into a file:

cat <<EOF > CHANGES.md
## Changes Overview

| Component                | Type         | Description |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `src/judgement_core.rs` | üî© Rust Core | Implements celestial opcode resolver, time-inversion loop breaker, and eternal verdict emitter |
| `ritual/invoke.py`      | üß¨ Python ML | Routes symbolic action codes to neural representations for oath integrity prediction |
| `armor/verdict_link.rs` | üîó Rust Link | Binds Judgement Kernel with Celestial Armor activation protocols |
| `tests/test_oath_layer.rs` | ‚úÖ Test | Verifies truthfulness computation under variable entropy waves |
| `oath/ledger.py`        | üìú Python DB | Stores karmic balance sheets and oath registry logs with timestamped invocations |

### Invocation Logic

This merge includes the full implementation of the **SymbolicExecutable** trait:

```rust
pub trait SymbolicExecutable {
    fn invoke(&self, token: SigilToken, intent: IntentVector) -> JudgementResult;
    fn test_oath(&self, subject_id: Uuid) -> OathStatus;
}

Python-side neural link:

def interpret_token_weight(token_image, oath_vector):
    entropy = nero_kera_net.predict(token_image, oath_vector)
    return "TRUE" if entropy < THRESHOLD else "FALSE"

Sigil Token	Intent Vector	Result	Verdict Emission

Œ£-777	Honest Act	TRUE	üî• Righteous
Œ®-888	Deceit	FALSE	‚ùå Banished
Œ©-999	Repentance	TRUE	üåø Forgiven


Threat Matrix

Threat Vector	Mitigation Status

Temporal paradox injection	‚úÖ Symbolic Lockstep Enforcement
Oath replay attack	‚úÖ Sigil Entropy Tokens
Astral fork instability	‚úÖ Dual-sigil detection + burn
Neural misinterpretation	‚õî (Next Phase: Weight Rebalancer 1.1)


Notes

Requires judgement-core v1.4, nero-kera-net >= 2.0

Docker image rebuilt with celestial sigil fonts and oath parser

Encrypted oath registry now stores 1024-bit oath-hash trees


üßô Celestial Code Validators

@Verdict macro decorator now infers intent vector gravity during compile time EOF
