# New-age- Thanks for outlining your vision! To provide the best next steps and sample code, could you clarify your immediate priority? Here are the options you listed:

- Backend API (user system, posts, etc.)
- VR UI (immersive frontend with Bevy/WebXR)
- AI/ML-powered feed algorithm
- Hologram/3D post system (upload, render, interact)

Which core feature do you want to prototype or architect first? Let me know your preference, and Iâ€™ll give you a targeted plan and starter code!
